OBJECTS AND OBJECT REFERENCES


1.	Given the the following declarations:

int area;
String name;

	a.	area is a primitive variable, and name is a reference variable.

b.	How many objects have been created? None

2.	Given the the following section of code:

String strA = new String("Oh! ");
String strB = new String("No! "); 

strA = strB;
System.out.print(strA);
System.out.println(strB);

	What is written to the monitor?  No! No!

3.	Given the the following section of code:

String strA = new String("Oh! ");
String strB = new String("No! "); 

strA = strB;
if (strA == strB)	
  system.out.println("Two copies of a reference.");
else
  system.out.println("Two different references.");

	What is written to the monitor?  Two copies of a reference.

4.	Examine the following section of code:

String strA = new String("String ");
String strB = new String("Cheese "); 

strA = strB;

How many objects have been created? After the last statement has executed, how many objects are now accessible (don't count garbage)?

Created: 2	Accessible: 1
5.	Examine the following section of code:

String strA;
strA = new String("Cheese ");
strA = new String("Theory ");
strA = new String("Bikini ");
strA = new String("Ensemble ");
strA = new String("Quartet ");

How many objects have been created? After the last statement has executed, how many objects are now accessible (don't count garbage)?

Created: 5	Accessible: 5

6.	Examine the following section of code:

String strA = new String("Cheese ");
String strB = new String("Theory ");
String strC = new String("Bikini ");
String strD = new String("Ensemble ");
String strE = new String("Quartet ");

How many objects have been created? After the last statement has executed, how many objects are now accessible (don't count garbage)?

Created: 5	Accessible: 5

7.	Examine the following section of code:

String strA = new String("Cheese ");
String strB = strA;
String strC = strA;
String strD = strA;
String strE = strA;

How many objects have been created? After the last statement has executed, how many objects are now accessible (don't count garbage)?

Created: 1	Accessible: 4

8.	An object that has no references to it is called garbage .

9.	If several reference variables refer to the same object, each variable is said to be an 
alias of the object.

10.	To check if two reference variables both refer to the same object, use the == operator.
To check if two different string objects contain equivalent data, use the equal method.
